This is my touchscreen mod for the uConsole.

uses a cheap resistive touchscreen from Aliexpress with the cable extened.

these are the touchscreen panel and control module. i had to extend the cable using an old ribbon cable but any thin wire would work.

the config file is for the calibration of the touchscreen. 

3d print files are for the spacer and stuff.
